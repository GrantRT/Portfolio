# Portfolio

## Introduction

I was given a task to create a portfolio for myself, containing the following sections:

- A section about me.
- A section containing working links to my work.
- A "Contact me" section

## Technology used

- HTML
- CSS

## Summary

I created my portfolio with the following features:

- A fixed header navbar with working links that scrolled to the different sections.
- A main profile picture of myself.
- "About me" section with a brief overview of my background/history.
- "My work" section with working image links to my projects and placeholders for future projects.
- "Contact me section with links to Email, Linkedin and github.
- Used flex-box and "@media screen" to ensure that the "My work" images are responsive and look good on mobile or other smaller devices.
